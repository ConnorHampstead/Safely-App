If you want, install https://standardjs.com/ to take care of the structural stuff.
Variable names still need to be done manually, though.

VARIABLE NAMES:
html pages must be named in camelCase
method names must be named in camelCase
variable names must be named in lower_underscore_case
class names must be named in TitleCase

COMMENTS:
Comments must be full sentences. Leave a space after
the comment symbol ( /* comment */ )

STRUCTURE:
leave two blank lines between functions and 
indent with two spaces, not with tabs
only use single quotes for strings ' '
  unless you have some single quotes within your string,
  in which case use double quotes " "
use === for comparisons
  use == if checking for null or undefined
  this includes using !== in place of !=
put a space after keywords (if (xyz) { ... }) 
  and function names (function name (args) { ... }
don't leave any unused variables
infix operators must be spaced ( x = 2 + 1 )
no lines longer than 80 characters ( including comments )
